# SPA
Started this repository to show information about the book 'Single Page Web Applications'.  Will use it for other SPA topics as well.
File SPA_JS_prototype.js is a modification of Prototype-based column of Table 2.3 on page 38 of SPA book - showing how to add functions to the object prototype before and after objet instantiation (using new operation). It is preferred to use Object.create(), but for those who want to see how you can "do classes in javascript", I have include this file for you. See page 59 for the prototype approach.
